# cache implementation
This project implement cache with LRU and MRU eviction policies

#LRU

Least recently used eviction policy evict data which is least frequently used, on other words which are used least number of times (old data). That algorithm removed the data which is used old in time than other data.


#MRU

Most recently used eviction policy evict data which is recently used. This policy works reversely than LRU or LFU.
